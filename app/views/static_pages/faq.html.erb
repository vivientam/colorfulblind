    <p class="bold">What is made-to-measure? How do I get made-to-measure pieces from ColorfulBlind?</p>
    <p>Made-to-measure garments are designs that can be constructed to meet each customer’s unique fit needs. Preview our collection either at a trunk show or at our showroom. Once you have selected the pieces you want, our in-house tailoring specialist will take your measurements and custom tailor the garment to best fit you. At ColorfulBlind, we believe that clothes should fit the wearer and not the other way around.</p>

    <p class="bold">What is patternmaking? Why is it special to ColorfulBlind?</p>
    <p>Patternmaking is both a science and an art. Creating the perfect pattern for a piece of clothing depends on finding the ratios that work best while maintaining the integrity of our designer’s vision. This is one of our strongest beliefs at ColorfulBlind – making sure our clothing can best fit you.</p>
